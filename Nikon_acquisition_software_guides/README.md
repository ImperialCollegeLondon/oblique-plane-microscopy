# dOPM_Shared_NIS_binaries #

Use the pdfs hyperlinked below as guides while running NIS-elements and having imported the binaries.

This readme needs directions on how to organise a JOBS database. 

worth noting that this is all Nikon NIS-Elements functionality so can be looked up in NIS-Elements help documentation.

## Introduction
The screenshot below shows JOBS explorer within NIS-Elements. Familiarise youreself with this and the use of JOBS scripts by using the help documentation within NIS-Elements.

The scripts in the screenshots are some simple routines we routinely use.

A typical acquisition would consist of the following in this order:

With x4/10x/20x, long working distance, air objectives:
1 - get plate z profile: uses GetPlateZProfile.bin
2 - do prefind with brightfield wide-field imaging
3 - manually select regions of interest from prefind data

Switch to water immersion 60X objective
4 - adjust prefind position list of regions of interest so all regions are centred in xyz on microscopes frames dOPM acquisition volume space: uses PrefindPoints.bin
5 - image beads before acquisition: uses dOPM_acquisition.bin
6 - do brightfield 60x images of region of interest point list: uses Brightfield.bin
7 - do dOPM timelapse acquisition of region of interest point list: uses dOPM_acquisition.bin
8 - do brightfield 60x images of region of interest point list: uses Brightfield.bin
9 - image beads after acquisition: uses dOPM_acquisition.bin

Notes to worry about for another day:
Ideally the multiwell plate will have a well with beads in 3D
Ideally some sample will not be timelapse imaged so you can control for light-dose
